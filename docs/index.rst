.. warning::
   This project is in the **BETA** stage of development. Please be aware that
   interfaces and functionality may change as the project develops. If this
   software is to be used in operational systems you are **strongly advised to
   use a released tag in your system configuration**, and you should be willing
   to accept incoming changes and bug fixes that require adaptations on your
   part. ECMWF **does use** this software in operations and abides by the same
   caveats.


earthkit-time is a library to manipulate dates and time for weather forecasting.
The library also exposes a command-line interface to its tools.
